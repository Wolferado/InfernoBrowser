# ChromiumBrowser
_Creating a Chromium based browser like a professionals in the team._

## Things important to know:
1. Branch ___"master"___ in ___"InfernoBrowser"___ repository is a branch for our co-op project. All pull requests go straight to this branch __(all fixes, changes, updates and etc.)__.

2. Repository ___"datorium-chromium"___ is a repository with the project which we have been developing together with Elchin on the sessions __(created to refresh or remember some details while coding)__. Updated with comments.

3. Clone ___"master"___ branch and use it for developing new features or coding. It would prevent from conflicts while merging your pull request with the branch.

List could be updated while working.

## Fixing cloning issue:
_If you encounter a problem, that this project won't load properly (a lot of errors in the code, designer can't load and etc.) you should do the following:_

1. Change your ___CPU configuration___ _(Build - Configuration Manager)_ and set Active solution platform to **x64**. _If you don't have that one, you should create it._

2. Install ___"AutoFixture"___ NuGet package. _(Project - Manage NuGet packages - Browse - Type in "AutoFixture" - Click "Install")_. Usually it solves all errors by installing all important packages.

3. Change at second layer class name to a different one _(even adding one letter would work)_. It fixes the Designer, so it could work.

## Don't be shy and code together like a team! :)
