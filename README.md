# ChromiumBrowser
_Creating a Chromium based browser like a professionals in the team._

## Things important to know:
1. Branch ___"master"___ in ___"InfernoBrowser"___ repository is a branch for our co-op project. All pull requests go straight to this branch __(all fixes, changes, updates and etc.)__.

2. Repository ___"datorium-chromium"___ is a repository with the project which we have been developing together with Elchin on the sessions __(created to refresh or remember some details while coding)__. Updated with comments.

3. Fork ___"master"___ branch and use it for developing new features or coding. It would prevent from conflicts when merging your pull request with the branch.

4. This project contains some NuGet packages for features to work and for stable processing:
* cef.redist.x64
* cef.redist.x86
* CefSharp.Common
* CefSharp.WinForms
* Syroot.Windows.IO.KnownFolders
* System.Security.Principal.Windows

List could be updated while working.

## Fixing cloning issue:
_If you encounter a problem, that this project won't load properly (a lot of errors in the code, designer can't load and etc.) you should do the following:_

1. Change your ___CPU configuration___ _(Build - Configuration Manager)_ and set Active solution platform to **x64**. _If you don't have that one, you should create it._

2. Install ___"AutoFixture"___ NuGet package. _(Project - Manage NuGet packages - Browse - Type in "AutoFixture" - Click "Install")_. Usually it solves all errors by installing all important packages.

3. Change at second layer class name to a different one _(even adding one letter would work)_. It fixes the Designer, so it could work.

## Don't be shy and code together like a team. :)
